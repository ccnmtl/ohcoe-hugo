A 20 year-old male presents to the clinic for a periodic examination. Medical
history shows that he suffers from clinical depression and receives therapy on
his school's campus with a psychiatrist. This young man has been your patient
for 6 years and he is back home for the summer from his sophomore year in
college. He has always had excellent oral hygiene and has never had dental
caries. Upon today's examination, the patient has one surface caries on 6 teeth
with interproximal radiographic calculus. When further questioned, he explains
the stresses of being a college student and divulges that he has been taking a
variety of prescription drugs given to him by his roommate. He begs you not to
tell his parents of his "experimentation" with drugs but realizes through
consultation that he does have a problem. He does not want to participate in
group rehabilitation but prefers individualized care. What treatment options
are available?
