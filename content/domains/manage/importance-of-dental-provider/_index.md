The opioid crisis is at the forefront of concerns in medicine. As early as
2016, a recent study in the American Medical Association concluded that after a
tooth extraction over 60 percent of 14-17 years olds were given a prescription
for opioids. Patients with histories of tobacco use and substance abuse are
more likely to use opioids long term. Comorbid health concerns including
depression and anxiety are often independent predictors of opioid misuse.
