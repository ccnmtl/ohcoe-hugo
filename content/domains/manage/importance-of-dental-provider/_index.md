The opioid crisis is among the forefront of concerns in medicine, and dentists
must share responsibility in minimizing the prescription of opioids.

As early as 2016, a study published by the American Medical Association
concluded that over 60 percent of 14-17 years olds were given a prescription
for opioids after a tooth extraction. Patients with histories of tobacco use,
and substance abuse, are more likely to use opioids long term. Comorbid
health concerns including depression, and anxiety, are often independent
predictors of opioid misuse.

Communication with the patient, knowing where to go for help, where to refer,
learning the signs of drug seeking behaviors, and managing pain conservatively
can help curb these trends.
