As research prompts precautions, protocols evolve regarding prescribing opioids
in the dental field. Dentistry continues to respond to the opioid epidemic by
aligning itself with therapists, support services, community centers,
hospitals, dental schools, rehabilitation centers, and other support services to
facilitate a patients healthy recovery. 

A patient presents to the clinic with a toothache, and extraction is needed.
The patient expresses frustration with ongoing tooth loss, and is not happy
with her smile. You inquire more about the patients' mental health, and upon
further discussion, she discloses that she smoked marijuana and uses other drugs
from time to time. You decide collaboration with other social support providers
is necessary.

I feel confident understanding the intersection of dentistry, social support
services, and the opioid epidemic.
