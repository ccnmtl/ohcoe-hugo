A 52-year old female patient presents to the clinic for a comprehensive
examination. When reviewing the patient's medical and social history, you read
that she has a history of smoking 5 cigarettes daily but has not smoked a
cigarette for 5 years. The patient's family history includes a deceased mother
who was addicted to crystal meth, a father who is a recovering alcoholic, and a
younger sister who has no significant findings.
