## Accessibility
Columbia University's Center for Teaching and Learning and College of Dental Medicine are committed to make Project OHCOE inclusive and accessible for all.

### Conformance Status
The Project OHCOE site is produced in accordance with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidlines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). The site is partially conformant to WCAG 2.0 Level AA.

### Limitations
The Project OHCOE site has been audited internal and evaluated with the assessment tools listed below. Some parts of the site may not fully conform to the WCAG 2.0 standards:

* The Project OHCOE site uses YouTube to deliver video content to the user. Parts of the YouTube player interface may not have sufficient contrast with elements placed underneath them.

### Assessment Approach
We assessed and tested AHE using the following tools. All pages show minor to no violations of the accessibility standards.

* [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) web accessibility testing tool by [Deque Systems](https://www.deque.com/)
  * We run this tool on every build of the site to ensure that we maintain conformance to the standards.
* [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/), the screen reader by Apple
* [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), an open-source automated auditor by Google
