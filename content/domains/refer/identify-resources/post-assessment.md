You are a dentist that begins providing care at a health care center in
Washington D.C. Knowing that Washington D.C. ranks third in opioid-related
overdoses in the United States, you decide to identify resources in
the community for substance use disorder services.

I feel committed to learning about patient-community substance use disorder
resources, beyond printed and digital referrals.
