A 52-year old female patient presents to the clinic for a comprehensive
examination. When reviewing the patient's medical and social history, you find
that she has a history of smoking 5 cigarettes daily, but has not smoked a
cigarette for 5 years.

The patient's family history includes a deceased mother who was addicted to
crystal meth, a father who is a recovering alcoholic, and a younger sister who
has no significant findings. 

Given a patient's family medical story, I feel comfortable assessing the risk
of various treatment and pain management options.
