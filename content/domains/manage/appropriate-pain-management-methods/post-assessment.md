A 62-year old male patient presents to the clinic for extraction of
unrestorable teeth #13, #14, #17 and #19. The last time this patient had
multiple teeth extracted, in 1999, he reports that he was prescribed Codeine by
Dr. Smith, which he remembers provided him great relief during his time of
recovery.

The patientâ€™s former dentist, Dr. Smith, is a colleague of yours that you often
to refer patients to. You explain to the patient that Codeine is not needed for
pain management, and there are contraindications to prescribing Codeine for the
extraction procedures that were completed on this date of service.

I feel confident providing alternative and/or appropriate pain management methods.
