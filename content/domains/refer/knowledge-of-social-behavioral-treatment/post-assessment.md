A 20 year-old male patient presents to the clinic for a periodic examination.
His medical history shows that he suffers from clinical depression, and is
treated by a psychiatrist on campus. He has been your patient for 6 years, and
is home for the summer from his sophomore year in college. He always has had
excellent oral hygiene, and never has had dental caries. Upon today's
examination the patient has one-surface caries on 6 teeth, with interproximal
radiographic calculus.

When questioned further, he explains the stresses of being a college student,
and divulges that he has been taking a variety of prescription drugs given to
him by his roommate. He begs you to not tell his parents of his
"experimentation" with drugs &mdash; but realizes, through consultation, that he
does have a problem. He does not want to participate in group rehabilitation
but prefers individualized care. Which treatment options are available?

To ensure this patient's follow-through, I would feel comfortable referring him
to the appropriate substance use disorder services.
