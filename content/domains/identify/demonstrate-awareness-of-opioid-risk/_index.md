The 40-year old patient from the previous section returns to the clinic two
weeks after the emergency evaluation for a partially impacted wisdom tooth, which led
to analgesic therapy and a referral to the oral surgeon for extraction of
symptomatic tooth. When you enter the operatory, the patient introduces himself
to you again, not remembering you from the last visit. The patient then begins
to hold his jaw in agony, crying, claiming that he could not make it to the
oral surgeon and ibuprofen was not enough for the pain. The patient then begins
to reveal that he has a history of cocaine abuse and Motrin has never been able
to work for pain - especially oral pain. The patient specifically asks for
Percocet 5mg/325mg, because that is what has worked in the past due to his "very
low threshold for pain."
