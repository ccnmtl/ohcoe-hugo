A 32-year old female patient presents for a 6-month periodic examination and
cleaning. You have been providing dental treatment to this patient since she
was 19 years old.

Three years ago, when she was pregnant, you provided treatment and follow-up
care for pregnancy gingivitis. Last year, she was in a car accident and had to
have surgery on her rotator cuff. You notice during this examination that her
oral hygiene and home care is not as thorough as it once was. Due to your
long-standing rapport with her, she divulges to you that she suffered from
postpartum depression and the hydrocodone she was prescribed post shoulder
surgery made her feel much better. She asks you if you could prescribe her
hydrocodone because of your history with her and how comfortable she has become
with you.
