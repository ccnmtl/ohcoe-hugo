A patient presents to the clinic with a toothache and extraction is needed. The
patient expresses frustration with ongoing tooth loss and is not happy with her
smile.  You inquire more about the patients' mental health and upon further
discussion she discloses that she smoked marijuana and uses other drugs from
time to time.  You decide collaboration with other social support providers is
necessary.
