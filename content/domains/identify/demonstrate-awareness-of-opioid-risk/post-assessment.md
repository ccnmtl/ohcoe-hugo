The 40-year old patient 1a. returns to the clinic two weeks after the emergency
evaluation for a partially impacted wisdom tooth led to analgesic therapy and a
referral to the oral surgeon for extraction of symptomatic tooth. When you
enter the operatory the patient introduces himself to you again, not
remembering you from the last visit. The patient then begins to hold his jaw in
agony, crying, claiming that he could not make it to the oral surgeon and
ibuprofen was not enough for the pain. The patient then begins to reveal that
he has a history of cocaine abuse and Motrin has never been able to work for
pain, especially oral pain. The patient asks specifically for Percocet
5mg/325mg because that is what has worked in the past due to his "very low
threshold for pain."

How comfortable are you addressing with the patient conducting a screening to
determine risk or presence of substance use disorder?
