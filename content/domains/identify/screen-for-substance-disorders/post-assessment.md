A 40-year old male patient presents to the clinic in acute pain. While the
dental assistant begins to take diagnostic radiographs the patient repeatedly
dozes off. When you arrive to the operatory, the patient finishes a conversation
on the telephone, then begins to hold his face reporting excruciating pain.

The patient’s wisdom tooth is partially impacted with no caries, no pathology,
no inflammation of gingiva. As the patient begins to describe his symptoms; you
notice some of his speech is slurred, and he becomes easily irritated with
follow-up questions. When you begin your intraoral examination, the patient has
poor oral hygiene with heavy plaque, heavy calculus build-up and a poor odor.
You decide to give the patient a prescription for Motrin 600mg and provide him
with a referral to have the symptomatic tooth extracted at an oral surgeon’s
office close to your location and schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks.

I am comfortable addressing with the patient conducting a screening to
determine risk or presence of substance use disorder.
